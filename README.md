## üé® UX Design Philosophy

* **User-Centric Design:** The platform is built around the needs of women, with a focus on creating an inclusive and welcoming space.
* **Intuitive Navigation:**  A clear and easy-to-use navigation structure allows users to quickly find the information they need.
* **Engaging Content:**  Stories and articles are presented in a visually appealing and interactive way to keep users engaged.
* **Responsive Design:** The platform adapts seamlessly to different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) for optimal viewing experiences.
* **Supportive Community:** Features like comments, or social sharing encourage connection and engagement between users.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

**Front-End:**

*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript:  The foundation of the website's structure and interactivity.
*   React.js: A component-based JavaScript library for building the user interface.
*   Bootstrap.js: A popular CSS framework for responsive design and UI elements.

**Back-End:**

*   Django REST Framework:  A powerful toolkit for building RESTful APIs to serve data to the frontend.
*   PostgreSQL: A robust and reliable database for storing user data, stories, articles, etc.

3.  **Install dependencies (backend):** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  **Setup the database:** `python manage.py migrate`

##  Troubleshooting

**1. Formatting Issues and styling issues :**

* Uneven spacing
* Cashing issies
* Inconsistent formatting
* The dropdownmenu requires additional styling - it does not provide with user friendly experience. 

**Solutions:** Specificity and Overriding - I used ore specific selectors or !important to override conflicting styles. 


**2. Broken Links:** While rendering the PostEditForm i got returned an "Uncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string". This error suggests that React encountered an undefined component during rendering, which can happen due to:

*Incorrect or missing imports.
*Typos in component names.
*Incorrect usage of default vs. named imports.
*Components not being properly exported. 



**3. Missing Information:**

* Incomplete installation instructions
* Not functioning components with buid API due to time restrictions
